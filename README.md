## Repos lost to time
These classes I've taken and done a good amount of projects were originally stored in gitlab.soe.ucsc.edu from 2019 - early 2021 were taken offline due to the University switching to gitlab.ucsc, I'm in the midst of searching for a source that may still have the gitlab server, but to no avail.
